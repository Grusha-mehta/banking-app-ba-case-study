## Problem Statement:
Currently, customers must call customer support to lock or unlock their debit/credit cards. This process is daunting and slo, especially outside business hour. This results in:
- Increased support center costs
- Delays in fraud prevention
- Frustrated customers
Adding this feature to the existing HelloBank application would reduce overhead and improve customer experience.
