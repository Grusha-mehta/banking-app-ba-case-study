# Banking App - Business Analyst Case Study
A business analysis case study simulating the addition of a Lock/Unlock Card feature in a mobile banking app. This project includes key BA atrifacts such as user stories, stakeholder analysis, process flows, wireframes, SQL queries and documentation. 
## Project overview 
The bank's mobile app lacks a Lock/Unlock card feature. Customers must call support to lock their cards, leading to delays, higher support costs, and customer dissatisfaction. 
This case study defines the problem, documents requirements, and outlines a proposed solution from a Business Analyst's perspective.
